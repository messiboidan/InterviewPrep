# InterviewPrep
Uploading all of the files I create as I practice for interview exams.

  I have recently been told that recruiters use github as a gauge for what experience a potential candidate has.
Sadly, most of my work to this day has been on local files on a harddrive that I just replaced. I've decided to upload
the work that I do to prepar into this repository to help showcase my skills.
